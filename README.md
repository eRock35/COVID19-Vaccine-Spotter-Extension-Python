# vaccineSpotterPython
This is an extension of vaccine spotter I use their api with a combination of twilo and python to monitor vaccine appointments and send texts to update a person. 
To see orginal Code which is very cool vist https://github.com/GUI/covid-vaccine-spotter
this code requires a twilo account they have a trial you may use which should be good enough to send texts to one phone number for a while. 
You can read more about twilo here https://www.twilio.com/messaging
Enjoy!
And shout out to GUI for creating vaccine spotter.
